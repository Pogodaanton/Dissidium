# Dissidium

The Discord bot noone asked for. Configurable, expandable and (most importantly) maintainable.

> **About this branch**: Due to slash-commands, the entire bot needs to be rewritten. Typing concerns and bad experience with TS and dynamic module loading brought the idea to switch to a C# based framework and bot. If the provided APIs reveal themself as insufficient, I will have to resort to JavaScript, so consider this branch more of a little exploration journey than a real project.
