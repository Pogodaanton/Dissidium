# Dissidium
The Discord bot noone asked for. Configurable, expandable and (most importantly) maintainable.

# Usage
No public builds available. You may build it though with `yarn build`. Else, the code has to run through ts-node.
> In production use the release branch. The master branch might be broken at times.

# Development
The project is currently managed with `yarn classic`, hence there is no support for use with `npm`.
Make use of the prepared prettier and eslint files when linting and formatting.
